INTRODUCTION
------------

This problem accepts two numbers x and y from the user, and computes their combination value xCy. 
The program achieves this with the help of two functions:
● To compute factorial
● To compute combination


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This program requires the following software:

 * gcc 

   - It is assumed that the system is Unix-like. 
     > However it should work on any system with gcc and on most C compilers.
   - The code was tested on gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11).

COMPILATION
-----------
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: gcc -o Src-comb_ES19BTECH11017.c Src-comb_ES19BTECH11017.c

USAGE
-----
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: ./Src-comb_ES19BTECH11017

   - It is assumed that the binary file is executable. If not, explicity set it to executable using chmod.

 * Input the data:

   - Enter x when prompted and hit <Enter>.
   - Enter y when prompted and hit <Enter>.
   - Enter if you want to continue or terminate the program and hit <Enter>.
   - In case of invalid input:
     > Follow the displayed instructions.

 * The data will be displayed in the following format (after each computation):
   - Result of the operation (on a newline)
