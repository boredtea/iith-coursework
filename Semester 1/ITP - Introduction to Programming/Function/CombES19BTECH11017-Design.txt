PURPOSE
-------

This problem accepts two numbers x and y from the user, and computes their combination value xCy. 
The program achieves this with the help of two functions:
● To compute factorial
● To compute combination

OVERALL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

The program uses a combination of the following elements to achieve its goal:
- for loop
- while loop
- if-else statements

PROGRAM STRUCTURE
-----------------

* Importing required header files:
  - <stdio.h>: for standard input/output statements
* Definition of the functions used in the program (excepting main()):
  - long long int factorial(int): computes factorial of the number passed to it and returns it as a long long int
    > computes using a for loop which multiplies all numbers starting from 1 up to the number passed to it
  - long long int combination(int, int): accepts two parameters returns it as a long long int
    > if the first number is greater than the second, returns -1
    > if input is valid, computes combinatioin (using the given formula and calling factorial()) and returns result as long long int data type
* Declaration of all the variables used in main()
* Using a while loop to continue taking input until the user choses otherwise
* Inside the while loop:
  - taking input of the two numbers to evaluate combination
  - passing the input to the combination() function (which in turn calls factorial()) an storing the returned value
  - printing the result:
    > if combination() returns status as -1, printing error message
    > otherwise, printing result of the computation
  - creating label "menu": used for asking user if they want to continue giving input
    > take input of user's choice:
      => if yes: stay inside while loop and repeat above steps
      => if no: print thank you message and exit while loop
      => invalid input: direct user back to choice input using the menu label
* Return 0 for main()
