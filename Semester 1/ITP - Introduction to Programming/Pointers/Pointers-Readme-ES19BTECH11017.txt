A C program to reverse a string using pointers. Given a string as an input, 
a function takes the input as a parameter and reverses that string.

   - It is assumed that the system is Unix-like. 
     > However it should work on any system with gcc and on most C compilers.
   - The code was tested on gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11).

COMPILATION
-----------
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: gcc -o Pointers-ES19BTECH11017 Pointers-ES19BTECH11017.c

USAGE
-----
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: ./Pointers-ES19BTECH11017

   - It is assumed that the binary file is executable. If not, explicity set it to executable using chmod.

 * Input the data:

   - Enter a string input when prompted and hit <Enter>.
     > length of the input string must be above zero and lesser than 10
   - In case of invalid input:
