INTRODUCTION
------------

A program to output the list of all even positive integers less than or equal to
N (N is a positive integer) and print their product. 

The number N is taken as input and stored as an int datatype. 

The product is stored as a long datatype and then displayed.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This program requires the following software:

 * gcc 

   - It is assumed that the system is Unix-like. 
     > However it should work on any system with gcc and on most C compilers.
   - The code was tested on gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.11).

COMPILATION
-----------
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: gcc -o Prod-ES19BTECH11017 Prod-ES19BTECH11017.c

USAGE
-----
 
 * Run the following command on the terminal: ./Prod-ES19BTECH11017

   - It is assumed that the binary file is executable. If not, explicity set it to executable using chmod.

 * Input the data:

   - Enter N (stored as int datatype) when prompted and hit <Enter>.
   - In case of invalid input or error:
     > Follow the displayed instructions.

 * The data will be displayed in the following format:
   - List of all even positive integers less than or equal to N
   - Product (stored as a double) of all even positive integers less than or equal to N (on a newline)
